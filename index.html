    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of 11 players each. It is popular globally, particularly in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa. The game is played on a large oval-shaped field, with a 22-yard pitch in the center.

        Cricket matches can be divided into three main formats: Test cricket, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) cricket. Test cricket is the longest format, lasting up to five days, while ODIs have 50 overs per team and typically last a day. T20 is the shortest format, with each team facing 20 overs.
        
        The game starts with a coin toss to decide which team bats or bowls first. The batting team aims to score as many runs as possible, while the bowling team tries to dismiss the batsmen. Runs are scored when the batsman hits the ball and runs between two wickets or hits the ball to the boundary.
        
        A cricket match is divided into overs, with each over consisting of six balls bowled by a bowler. Bowlers aim to outsmart the batsman and dismiss them through various tactics, such as bowling a delivery that hits the stumps (a bowled) or catches the batsman out.
        
        The primary fielding positions include wicketkeeper, slip fielders, and boundary riders. The wicketkeeper stands behind the stumps to catch balls the batsman misses. Fielders are strategically placed to prevent runs and take catches.
        
        There are different types of deliveries: fast bowling, spin bowling, and swing bowling. Fast bowlers rely on speed, while spin bowlers use a rotating motion to deceive the batsman. Swing bowlers use the ball's movement through the air to create difficulty for the batsman.
        
        A batsman can be dismissed in various ways: being bowled, caught, run out, stumped, or trapped LBW (leg before wicket). The batsman must protect the stumps and avoid getting out.
        
        The role of the captain is crucial in cricket, as they make decisions regarding batting orders, field placements, and bowling rotations. Captains are often leaders on the field, providing motivation and strategic guidance.
        
        Cricket has a rich history dating back to the 16th century in England. It became an international sport in the 19th century, with the first Test match played between Australia and England in 1877. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body for the sport.
        
        The ICC organizes major tournaments such as the ICC Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and ICC Champions Trophy. These events attract millions of viewers worldwide and feature intense competition among the best teams.
        
        The most famous cricket rivalry is between India and Pakistan, with matches between these two nations often drawing huge attention. Other notable cricket rivalries include Australia vs. England (The Ashes) and South Africa vs. Australia.
        
        Cricket is not only a sport but also a cultural phenomenon, with passionate fan bases and traditions. The game has evolved over the years, with advancements in technology, such as the Decision Review System (DRS) and the use of analytics in strategy.
        
        In recent years, the growth of T20 leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) has revolutionized the sport, offering high entertainment value with shorter, faster-paced games.
        
        Cricket has also contributed to social causes and charity initiatives, with players often involved in community outreach programs. The sport has a unique place in global culture, and its ability to bring people together through competition and camaraderie is a testament to its enduring popularity.
        
        Overall, cricket is a complex, strategic, and exhilarating sport that continues to grow and evolve, captivating audiences worldwide.
