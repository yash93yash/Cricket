    <h2>About Nepal Cricket Team</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The Nepal national cricket team represents the country in international cricket, governed by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN). The team made its debut in 1996 at the ICC World Cup Qualifier, marking the beginning of its international journey. Since becoming an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), Nepal has participated in various global events, such as the ICC World Cup Qualifiers, ICC World T20, and ACC tournaments. Nepal achieved One Day International (ODI) status in 1997, a significant milestone in its cricketing history. The team has a rich legacy of captains, with **Paras Khadka** being the most notable among them. Khadka, a cricketing icon in Nepal, has been instrumental in raising the profile of the sport in the country. The team’s primary home ground is the **Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground** in Kirtipur, Kathmandu, which hosts most of their international matches.

        Nepal has a fierce rivalry with teams like the UAE, Hong Kong, and Afghanistan, and they regularly compete against them in ICC events. Players like **Gyanendra Malla** and **Sharneel Shrestha** have contributed significantly to the team’s success over the years. The rise of **Sandeep Lamichhane**, Nepal’s most famous cricketer, has brought global attention to the country’s cricket scene. Lamichhane has played in various international T20 leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Caribbean Premier League (CPL), helping elevate Nepal's stature in world cricket. Over time, Nepal has had several domestic and foreign coaches, with guidance from coaches of diverse backgrounds, aiding the team’s development. Nepal's style of play is aggressive, but they often face challenges when competing against top-tier international sides.
        
        Despite its challenges in infrastructure and player development, Nepal has continued to improve. The country's cricketing scene is growing, with domestic tournaments like the **Everest Premier League** (EPL) contributing to the discovery of new talent. Nepal’s cricket fanbase is large and passionate, and matches often attract large crowds, especially when key players like Khadka and Lamichhane are involved. Sponsorship deals are increasing, although the financial support remains a challenge compared to full ICC members. The team’s performance in international tournaments like the ICC World T20 has brought them recognition, though they have yet to break through into the higher echelons of world cricket. Despite these obstacles, Nepal's cricket scene has made significant strides, and the country's cricketing future looks bright, with increasing attention on youth development programs and a growing interest in the sport among the younger generation.</p>
