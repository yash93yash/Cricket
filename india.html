    <h2>About Indian Cricket Team</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Indian cricket team is one of the most successful and popular teams in the world. Representing India in international cricket, it is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). India has a rich cricketing history, with the team making significant contributions to the sport.

        The Indian team is known for its passionate fan base and its major achievements in cricketing history. It won its first ICC Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the West Indies in the final. The team’s second World Cup victory came in 2007, with a thrilling win over Sri Lanka. The 2007 win also marked the rise of India in the T20 format with the inception of the ICC T20 World Cup.
        
        India's most famous captain, Kapil Dev, led the team to its 1983 World Cup win, while Sourav Ganguly is remembered for revitalizing the team in the early 2000s. MS Dhoni's leadership saw India win the 2007 ICC World T20, 2011 ICC World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, making him one of the most successful captains in history.
        
        The Indian cricket team has produced legendary players like Sachin Tendulkar, who is considered one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and Virat Kohli, another cricketing icon known for his aggressive and consistent batting. Other notable players include Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, and Kapil Dev.
        
        The team has a fierce rivalry with Pakistan, and matches between the two countries are among the most anticipated in world cricket. India also has strong rivalries with Australia, England, and South Africa. The Ashes series between India and Australia has been especially competitive in recent years.
        
        The Indian Premier League (IPL) has contributed significantly to the development of Indian cricket, providing a platform for young talent to shine and for international players to compete in a fast-paced format.
        
        India’s cricketing success is also backed by a robust domestic structure, including tournaments like the Ranji Trophy, which serves as a stepping stone for aspiring cricketers.
        
        The team’s success in all formats, Test cricket, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and T20s, has placed it among the top cricketing nations. The Indian team continues to be a dominant force in world cricket, consistently ranked at the top in both ODIs and Tests.
        
        Key players in the team, apart from Virat Kohli, include Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, and KL Rahul, who contribute significantly in various formats. India's batting lineup is known for its depth and power, while the bowling unit has become more formidable, with strong pacers and spinners.
        
        The team’s achievements are celebrated nationwide, making cricket a significant part of India’s sporting culture. The Indian cricket team has an unparalleled legacy, with its fans supporting the team passionately, whether they are playing at home or abroad.</p>
